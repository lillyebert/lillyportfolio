### About Me
Hello! I am currently a sophomore at Loyola University Maryland.
With skills in excel, python, access, and coding, I am able to create spreadsheets to organize and analyze data, and achieve a greater understanding of the data. I am adept at using onlinegdb, jdoodle, and access.
My great skill set, commitment to excellent work, and passion for coding garners me as a valuable asset. In my spare time, I like to draw and read. You can find me on (link linkedin)

### Projects

#### Grade Calculator
- ![Grade Calculator](<Grade Calculator.png>)
- [Read the Report](link-to-report)
- I came up with this project because I wanted an easy way to calculate my grades in my classes. I wanted an accurate and easy way to plug in my assignment and test grades and be able to easily see my current grade. It was needed because moodle is not always accurate or up to date with grades. I used excel to complete this project. I had a little bit of trouble figuring out how to calculate the final grade in excel using the information I provided but I was able to fix it. I used the grades I received on moodle and the syllabus for my classes to calculate the weight for each assignment. I did not collaborate with anyone else. I set out to have a document where I had all my grades easily laid out and a way to accurately calculate my final grade for a class. If I had the chance to take this further I would have done it for each of my classes but I did not have the time for it originally.
Summary:
In this project I wrote out all my assignments, their weight, and the points I earned for them. Then, I calculated the grade I received for each assignment. I then used the grades I received and calculated my final grade and letter grade for the class.

#### Budget Tracker
- ![Budget Tracker](<Budget Tracker.png>)
- I came up with this project because I wanted a sheet where I could easily see my expenses and what I needed to pay for. I used excel spreadsheets to complete this project. I had a little bit of difficulty figuring out how to add up and calculate everything on excel but I figured it out. I used some hypothetical expenses that I would have. I did not collaborate with anyone. I wanted to have a document where I could easily see what I needed to budget for and where I should be spending money on and what I should be saving. Yes, I achieved it. If I had more time I would improve the layout of the project.
Summary:
In this project, I created a budget tracker which tracked how much money I was spending on certain things like food and housing. I wanted a clear document which would show me how I should balance my money.

#### Course Grade Evaluator
- ![Course Grade Evaluator](<Course Grade Evaluator.png>)
- I created this project because I wanted a different way to calculate my grades and my gpa. I used jdoodle to complete this project. I had difficulty coding this and getting everything to work right at first but I was able to fix it. I used the resources that were provided on moodle but I did not collaborate with anyone else. I set out to have a code which would calculate the weighted and unweighted average of my grades. If I could make improvements I would make it so I am able to add more grades.
Summary:
In this project, I created a code in python which would show my quiz average, my assessment average, my unweighted average, and my weighted average grade. I made it so I could easily add my grades and calculate the averages.
